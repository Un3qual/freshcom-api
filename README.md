# Freshcom API

Freshcom API is undergoing some architectural changes. This repo will be slowly migrated to [freshcom](https://github.com/freshcom/freshcom) and [freshcom_web](https://github.com/freshcom/freshcom_web).

This repo is deprecated.

The Web API will not change and the docs in [https://docs.freshcom.io/](https://docs.freshcom.io/) and [freshcom-api-reference](https://github.com/freshcom/freshcom-api-reference)
will stay as is and and serve as a reference to what will be available in the beta version. However development for the [Freshcom Dashboard](https://github.com/freshcom/freshcom-dashboard)
will be slowed down for a bit.
