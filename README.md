# Freshcom API

Freshcom API is undergoing major changes. It will soon to be seperated into two different
repos. **freshcom** and **freshcom_web**.

This is so that backend developer can extend the feature of freshcom much easily and
developers that want to build their own web layer can have choice of not including
the default web layer.

A sneak peak of what will soon be available is in this draft of [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/freshcom/freshcom-api/wiki/Getting-Started-(Draft))
